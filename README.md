# Image Mag

This is a website design for a new kind of photography magazine or portfolio. It sports large, responsive photos and has a space for adding more images to the project header that load on dropdown. Here are some screenshots of the design:

## Download
You can download the full development package or just use the compiled files (HTML, CSS, JS). The compiled files are located in the /build folder. 

The development files include:

- Bootstrap 4
- SASS
- Jade (now Pug)
- BrowserSync
- Gulp
- Image Compression

Everything is ready to go, just download, open the command line, cd into the directory where the website is, type 'gulp start', and set your browser to localhost:3000. BroswerSync will be ready to go when you save changes to the code. This development setup requires Node.js to get started. [Download Node here](https://nodejs.org/en/). To learn more about this setup, [check out this repo for my development starter kit](https://github.com/brianhaferkamp/dev-startup-kit-bootstrap4-gulp). The readme has a lot of good information that comes in handy when using this build system.

Please leave any issues if you run into them. And feel free to make this design better!
